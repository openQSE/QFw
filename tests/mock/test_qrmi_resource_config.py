# QRMI 0.25.0 added QuantumResource.from_config(), which takes a resource's
# settings as a dict instead of reading them from the process environment. The
# driver prefers it, because the environment is what made two reservations in
# one shim process able to tread on each other: the settings are process-wide,
# and QRMI through 0.24.4 read the IBM Quantum System object-storage pair
# inside task_result() rather than at construction, so a second reservation
# opening its resource could replace the AWS key a first reservation had yet
# to read.
#
# Two things these guard. The map is built by ONE resolver shared with the
# environment path, so the two cannot drift; test_the_two_paths_agree is the
# check that matters, since the precedence is subtle (a credential replaces, a
# bare call fills in, the CRN has a four-level order). And the map STARTS from
# the environment, because QRMI ignores the environment once a map is given
# and reads settings this driver does not model, including the acquisition
# token and the QRS/QCS session settings that the SPANK plugin sets.
